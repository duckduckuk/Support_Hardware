Foscam 9900 MJPEG Stream URL

netcam_url http://IP-ADDRESS/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?cmd=snapPicture2&usr=USERNAME&pwd=PASSWORD

Obviously fill in your IP address, username and password set within the camera admin. I was using this with the Foscam FI9900P 1080P Full HD IP Security CCTV Camera.

For your username and password within Motion, simply comment out the line:

 ; netcam_userpass value

I tried for hours trying all combinations of urls, to find that the one above worked quite well, with full resolution MPEG streaming.

I recommend Mr-Daveâ€™s fork of Motion which can be cloned from github.
